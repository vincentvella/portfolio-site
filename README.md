# Personal Site

Written with NextJS, Tailwind, and [Outstatic](https://outstatic.com)

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## CV Page Info

Built with some influence from [Bartosz Jarocki's CV Project](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv)

I wanted to build something a bit more maintainable to add/remove items.
In the past, I've created resume projects where I've had to modify my details and add new items directly in the code.
By building something like Bartosz did on top of a static CMS such as [Outstatic](https://outstatic.com) deployed within my NextJS site - I am able to make changes to my resume without even needing to be in front of my computer.
