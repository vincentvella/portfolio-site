Built a cross-platform app to display upcoming performing arts events from all of the performing arts programs around Pennsylvania State University. The app showed all the event details, including the name, performing group(s), location, time, and ticket prices. I built a way to pop open the ticket website from within the app so people could purchase tickets without leaving the app. I built out social share and RSVP after I left the university so groups could see how large a crowd to expect.

Eventually, the university shut down the app and decided to replace it with something built by someone on staff.
